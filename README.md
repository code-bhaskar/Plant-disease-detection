# Plant Disease Detection using Image Classification

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](link_to_your_colab_notebook_here)

## Overview

This project demonstrates a simple image classification approach to detect diseases in plants using images of their leaves. It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow and Keras to classify images into different disease categories (and healthy categories). The project leverages a publicly available plant disease dataset.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

*   `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.
*   `PlantDiseaseDetection-1.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data loading, preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation.
*   `requirements.txt`: A list of Python packages required to run the notebook.
*   `/models` (Optional): A directory to store trained model weights.
*   `/.gitignore` (Important): Specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.

## Dependencies

The following Python packages are required:

*   tensorflow
*   keras
*   numpy
*   pandas
*   matplotlib
*   opencv-python (cv2)
*   scikit-learn
*   kagglehub
